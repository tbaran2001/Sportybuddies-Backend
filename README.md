# SportyBuddies API

## About The Project

This project is an implementation of the API for the "SportyBuddies" application, designed to help users find partners for joint sports activities. The application allows users to register, log in, and personalize their profiles. Users can specify their sports interests, enabling the app to match them with suitable partners based on preferences and location. Matched users can also communicate through an integrated chat feature, allowing them to coordinate and plan their activities.
